Hi all!

I wanted to create a project that would connect students and tutors to one another. My biggest challenge was taking the information collected on the Google form questionnaire to my code.
I was hoping to explore this more but I ran out of time in the end and decided to instead allow the students to choose their tutor based on a small bio. Because the organization, Student
Tutoring for Underresourced Determined Youth (STUDY), is not running right now (but hopefully will be re-established over the summer) I don't have real bios from tutors. Writing fake interests felt a little boring
so I decided to give you all a laugh by filling in funny bios that one might see on a dating app. I havn't woked with GitHub very much so please contact me if anything isn't working. I actually
coded my project on Dr. Java (lol) and referenced some code I did in my senior year of high school. I hope you like it and find it a little funny.
