Hi all!

I wanted to create a project that would connect student's and tutors to one another. My biggest challenge was taking the information collected on the google form questionnaire to my code.
I was hoping to explore this more but I ran out fo time int eh end and decided to intead allow teh studen to choose tehir tutor based on a small bio. Because the oragnizination, STUDY (Student
tutoring for Underresourced Determined Youth) is not running right now (but hopefully will re-established over the summer) I don't have data from tutors. Filling this in felt a little boring
so I decided to give you all a laugh by filling in funny bios that one might see ona  dating app. I havn;t woked with github very much so please contact me fi anything isn't working. I actually
coded my project on Dr. Java (lol) and referenced some code I did my senior year of high school. I hope you like it and find it a little funny.
